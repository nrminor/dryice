Fast intermediate data representations for biological data. Don't put it in the minus-80â€”just put it on dry ice!

## Overview

`dryice` is a lossy, highly efficient on-disk representation of genetic sequencing data that is optimized for serialization and deserialization speed. Currently, it supports sequencing reads, quality scores for each base, and limited metadata for each read. `dryice` is most useful for dumping sequencing reads from large data files into temporary files, which can be quickly "picked up" and used later. It can also be used to store k-mer or minimizer sketches in a quickly accessible way.

Like dry ice itself, `dryice` files are not intended for long-term storage, nor will it ever be optimized for minimal disk usage. Additionally, the current `dryice` format specification is rapidly evolving, meaning that (support for) your current `dryice` files may soon sublimate into thin air!

That said, `dryice` has the following features:

- maximally compact, two-bit-packed nucleotides with support for the four canonical DNA bases
- lossy encoding removes information like IUPAC ambiguous bases and alignment information from BAM files
- control over how lossy a file is. For example, if you only want sequences and no quality scores, IDs, metadata, etc., you can do that!
- want to put k-mers on dry ice instead of whole sequences? You can do that! Only want minimizers? You can do that too!
- parallelized read processing within an internal asynchronous streaming engine
- fast conversion to and from FASTQ, gzipped-FASTQ, and BAM formats, as well as standard input and standard output. Converting a `dryice` file to a BAM file, for example, is significantly faster than converting FASTQ to BAM
- direct conversion into tabular Apache Arrow format
- single or multiple `dryice` file input and output, with controls over max per-`dryice`-file sizes
- transparent `dryice` file writing, or file writing hidden away in system temporary directories
- a "sublimate mode" that automatically deletes `dryice` files after a specified time interval as a kind of disk "garbage collection"
- a speedy `dryice`-format-native lua API for pre-processing reads before they're returned to a normal bioinformatic format

## Interested in support for other data types?

Reach out! `dryice` builds upon customizable bit-encodings, which means additional kinds of data could be represented (granted, with more than two bits).
